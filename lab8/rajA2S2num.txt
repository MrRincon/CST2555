00001	SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
      
      
00002	     Enter ROMEO
      
00003	ROMEO
      
00004	     He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
00005	     JULIET appears above at a window
00006	     But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
00007	     It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
00008	     Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
00009	     Who is already sick and pale with grief,
00010	     That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
00011	     Be not her maid, since she is envious;
00012	     Her vestal livery is but sick and green
00013	     And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
00014	     It is my lady, O, it is my love!
00015	     O, that she knew she were!
00016	     She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
00017	     Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
00018	     I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
00019	     Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
00020	     Having some business, do entreat her eyes
00021	     To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
00022	     What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
00023	     The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
00024	     As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
00025	     Would through the airy region stream so bright
00026	     That birds would sing and think it were not night.
00027	     See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
00028	     O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
00029	     That I might touch that cheek!
      
00030	JULIET
      
00031	     Ay me!
      
00032	ROMEO
      
00033	     She speaks:
00034	     O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
00035	     As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
00036	     As is a winged messenger of heaven
00037	     Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
00038	     Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
00039	     When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
00040	     And sails upon the bosom of the air.
      
00041	JULIET
      
00042	     O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
00043	     Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
00044	     Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
00045	     And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
      
00046	ROMEO
      
00047	     [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
      
00048	JULIET
      
00049	     'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
00050	     Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
00051	     What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
00052	     Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
00053	     Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
00054	     What's in a name? that which we call a rose
00055	     By any other name would smell as sweet;
00056	     So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
00057	     Retain that dear perfection which he owes
00058	     Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
00059	     And for that name which is no part of thee
00060	     Take all myself.
      
00061	ROMEO
      
00062	     I take thee at thy word:
00063	     Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
00064	     Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
      
00065	JULIET
      
00066	     What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
00067	     So stumblest on my counsel?
      
00068	ROMEO
      
00069	     By a name
00070	     I know not how to tell thee who I am:
00071	     My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
00072	     Because it is an enemy to thee;
00073	     Had I it written, I would tear the word.
      
00074	JULIET
      
00075	     My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
00076	     Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
00077	     Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
      
00078	ROMEO
      
00079	     Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
      
00080	JULIET
      
00081	     How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
00082	     The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
00083	     And the place death, considering who thou art,
00084	     If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
      
00085	ROMEO
      
00086	     With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
00087	     For stony limits cannot hold love out,
00088	     And what love can do that dares love attempt;
00089	     Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
      
00090	JULIET
      
00091	     If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
      
00092	ROMEO
      
00093	     Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
00094	     Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
00095	     And I am proof against their enmity.
      
00096	JULIET
      
00097	     I would not for the world they saw thee here.
      
00098	ROMEO
      
00099	     I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
00100	     And but thou love me, let them find me here:
00101	     My life were better ended by their hate,
00102	     Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
      
00103	JULIET
      
00104	     By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
      
00105	ROMEO
      
00106	     By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
00107	     He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
00108	     I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
00109	     As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
00110	     I would adventure for such merchandise.
      
00111	JULIET
      
00112	     Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
00113	     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
00114	     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
00115	     Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
00116	     What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
00117	     Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
00118	     And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
00119	     Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
00120	     Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
00121	     If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
00122	     Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
00123	     I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
00124	     So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
00125	     In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
00126	     And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
00127	     But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
00128	     Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
00129	     I should have been more strange, I must confess,
00130	     But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
00131	     My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
00132	     And not impute this yielding to light love,
00133	     Which the dark night hath so discovered.
      
00134	ROMEO
      
00135	     Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
00136	     That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
      
00137	JULIET
      
00138	     O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
00139	     That monthly changes in her circled orb,
00140	     Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
      
00141	ROMEO
      
00142	     What shall I swear by?
      
00143	JULIET
      
00144	     Do not swear at all;
00145	     Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
00146	     Which is the god of my idolatry,
00147	     And I'll believe thee.
      
00148	ROMEO
      
00149	     If my heart's dear love--
      
00150	JULIET
      
00151	     Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
00152	     I have no joy of this contract to-night:
00153	     It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
00154	     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
00155	     Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
00156	     This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
00157	     May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
00158	     Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
00159	     Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
      
00160	ROMEO
      
00161	     O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
      
00162	JULIET
      
00163	     What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
      
00164	ROMEO
      
00165	     The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
      
00166	JULIET
      
00167	     I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
00168	     And yet I would it were to give again.
      
00169	ROMEO
      
00170	     Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
      
00171	JULIET
      
00172	     But to be frank, and give it thee again.
00173	     And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
00174	     My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
00175	     My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
00176	     The more I have, for both are infinite.
00177	     Nurse calls within
00178	     I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
00179	     Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
00180	     Stay but a little, I will come again.
00181	     Exit, above
      
00182	ROMEO
      
00183	     O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
00184	     Being in night, all this is but a dream,
00185	     Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
00186	     Re-enter JULIET, above
      
00187	JULIET
      
00188	     Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
00189	     If that thy bent of love be honourable,
00190	     Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
00191	     By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
00192	     Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
00193	     And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
00194	     And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
      
00195	Nurse
      
00196	     [Within] Madam!
      
00197	JULIET
      
00198	     I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
00199	     I do beseech thee--
      
00200	Nurse
      
00201	     [Within] Madam!
      
00202	JULIET
      
00203	     By and by, I come:--
00204	     To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
00205	     To-morrow will I send.
      
00206	ROMEO
      
00207	     So thrive my soul--
      
00208	JULIET
      
00209	     A thousand times good night!
00210	     Exit, above
      
00211	ROMEO
      
00212	     A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
00213	     Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
00214	     their books,
00215	     But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
00216	     Retiring
00217	     Re-enter JULIET, above
      
00218	JULIET
      
00219	     Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
00220	     To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
00221	     Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
00222	     Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
00223	     And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
00224	     With repetition of my Romeo's name.
      
00225	ROMEO
      
00226	     It is my soul that calls upon my name:
00227	     How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
00228	     Like softest music to attending ears!
      
00229	JULIET
      
00230	     Romeo!
      
00231	ROMEO
      
00232	     My dear?
      
00233	JULIET
      
00234	     At what o'clock to-morrow
00235	     Shall I send to thee?
      
00236	ROMEO
      
00237	     At the hour of nine.
      
00238	JULIET
      
00239	     I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
00240	     I have forgot why I did call thee back.
      
00241	ROMEO
      
00242	     Let me stand here till thou remember it.
      
00243	JULIET
      
00244	     I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
00245	     Remembering how I love thy company.
      
00246	ROMEO
      
00247	     And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
00248	     Forgetting any other home but this.
      
00249	JULIET
      
00250	     'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
00251	     And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
00252	     Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
00253	     Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
00254	     And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
00255	     So loving-jealous of his liberty.
      
00256	ROMEO
      
00257	     I would I were thy bird.
      
00258	JULIET
      
00259	     Sweet, so would I:
00260	     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
00261	     Good night, good night! parting is such
00262	     sweet sorrow,
00263	     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
00264	     Exit above
      
00265	ROMEO
      
00266	     Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
00267	     Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
00268	     Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
00269	     His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
00270	     Exit
